# What?
Gerbers which have been sent to fab to build hardware. 

If you just want to buy some boards, those can be purchased directly from http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=22117&accesskey=. 
You're welcome to buy them elsewhere, but because of the large size (~100mm x ~60mm) services like OSHPark are comically expensive.
I recommend things that charge by board size bucket (DirtyPCBs, Seeed, etc).
